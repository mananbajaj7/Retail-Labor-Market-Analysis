# 🛍️ Retail Labor Market Trends Analysis

This project explores evolving labor market dynamics in the retail sector, using large-scale job posting and workforce sentiment data. The analysis uncovers key structural changes in hiring behavior, worker satisfaction, and geographic variation in labor conditions — offering insights into where and why retail jobs are declining.

## 📁 Objective

* Analyze hiring slowdowns and job market share of retail from 2020–2024
* Understand why retail roles are taking longer to fill
* Investigate trends in employee satisfaction, pay, and regional differences

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. 📉 Declining Job Postings

* Retail job postings peaked in 2022 (\~10% of market), then declined sharply
* By 2024, retail roles make up just **1.42% of job listings**
* Shift driven by inflation, value spending, and reduced consumer demand

### 2. 🕒 Longer Time to Fill

* Time-to-fill rose from \~30 days (2020–2023) to **54 days** in 2024
* Represents a **70% increase**, signaling low applicant interest and mismatch between employer offers and worker expectations

### 3. 😞 Rising Worker Dissatisfaction

* Retail workers report record lows in:

  * Compensation & benefits
  * Work-life balance
  * Overall morale
* Since 2019, sentiment has fallen especially for hourly and sales roles

### 4. 🌍 Regional Trends

* **West Coast states** (CA, WA, OR, ID, NV) show higher satisfaction scores
* Better compensation relative to cost-of-living may explain regional variance
